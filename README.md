# _EPICODUS STUDENT PROJECT | BDD Practice: Build a pig latin translator_

#### _Pig Latin Translator, June 8, 2016_

#### By _**Marty Fitchen, Maldon Meehan, Epicodus**_

## Description

_This is an Epicodus student project creating a web page that uses front-end user interface logic to gather an input and translate it to pig latin (using back-end logic). This is an lesson in Behavior Driven Development (BDD) to learn to code using just the least amount of clean code to establish true and false booleans based on expected outputs based on potential user inputs._

Behavior  | Input Example | Output Example
------------- | ------------- | -------------
Inputted word(s) starts with a vowel then add "ay" to the end of the word(s).  | Apple  | Appleay
Inputted word(s) start(s) with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end and add "ay" to the end of the word(s).  | Through the void  | oughThray ethay oidvay
Inputted word(s) start(s) with "qu", move the "u" with the "q" to the end and add "ay" to the end of the word(s).  | Quality queen  | alityQuay eenquay
Inputted word(s) start(s) with "y", treat "y" like a consonant and move it to the end and add "ay" to the end of the word(s).  | Yes you can  | esYay ouyay ancay
