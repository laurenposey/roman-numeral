# _EPICODUS STUDENT PROJECT | BDD Practice: Build a roman numeral converter_

#### _Roman Numeral Converter, June 9, 2016_

#### By _**Marty Fitchen, Lauren Valkyrie, Epicodus**_

## Description

_This is an Epicodus student project creating a web page that uses front-end user interface logic to gather an input (in this case a number 1-3999) and convert it to a roman numeral (using back-end logic). This is an lesson in Behavior Driven Development (BDD) to learn to code using just the least amount of clean code to establish true and false booleans based on expected outputs based on potential user inputs._

Behavior  | Input Example | Output Example
------------- | ------------- | -------------
Alert flag for any inputted number less than 1 or greater than 3,999.  | 4,200  | alert("Please enter a number between 1 and 3,999")
Determine if the inputted value is less than 10.  | 9  | IX
Determine if the inputted value is less than 100.  | 87  | LXXXVII
Determine if the inputted value is less than 1000.  | 999  | CMXCIX
